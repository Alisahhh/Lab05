## A Fack Network Tool

### Introduction

This is a fack network tool.You can enter 1~4 to broadcast and get the IP address and MAC address of all surviving hosts in the LAN,attack a host,resolve DNS and quit.

### Using method

cmake .

make

sudo ./ARPTools

### Tips

I am too lazy and I write some hard code.Please rewrite your MAC address and IP address by yourself.

And this Tool maybe have some bug.If you find it,I am so sorry.

I will write it in the future.
